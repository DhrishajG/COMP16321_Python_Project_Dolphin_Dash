This is a game I developed for my First Year programming coursework, COMP16321-Introduction to Programming 1. I made use of Python's tkinter library to make this game, as per module instructions. 
To play the game, clone all the files in this repository and in the terminal run the command to run the python file, game.py
Once you have started the game it should show you a homescreen. Try navigating through the different options. 
To start playing, click on "new game". The goal is simple: move the dolphin up and down using the up and down arrow keys to eat the smaller fish and avoid everything else. You have three lives per game. The game is over once the user looses all three lives. The user will then be prompted to go back to the main menu. 
There is a customise button to change your dolphin appearance. There is also a leaderboard that keeps track of the player's score. To create a new leaderboard simple delete the contents of "leaderboard.txt" in the /db folder (DO NOT DELETE THE FILE).
The controls for when you have entered the game are as follows:
<Up> move the dolphin up
<Down> move the dolphin down
<space> pause the game
<B> boss key
There are two cheat codes in the game: turtle cheat (that gives user and extra life) and invincibility cheat (that makes the user immune to damage from other creatures for a small period of time). Try to figure out what they are ;)
Hope you enjoy playing my game.
